## About

This is my own and beloved setup of almost all console tools I'm used to use.

Take this and eat it, if you'd like

Vim shortcut key:

* *Control-h* Disable higlighting
* *Tab* Add Tabs in the selected text (visual mode)
* *Shift-Tab* Remove Tabs in the slected text (visual mode)
* *F2* Numbering lines
* *F5-F7* Colour scheme 
* *F8* Exec python script
.
